description: Create subtasks from a plan and store them in Linear
argument-hint: [linear-issue-id]
---

Break down a plan (from planning mode or inferred context) into smaller, independently-executable subtasks. Each subtask is stored in Linear with sufficient context to be completed in a separate Claude session.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Critical Principle: Subtask Self-Sufficiency

**Each subtask will be executed in a completely fresh Claude session with ZERO prior context.** Claude will NOT:

- Fetch the parent ticket to read its description
- Have access to conversation history from when the plan was created
- Know anything about the codebase beyond what's in the subtask description
- Remember decisions or context from other subtasks

Therefore, each subtask description **MUST be completely self-contained**. Copy over ALL relevant context:

- Background and motivation from the parent ticket
- Relevant information from ticket comments
- Architectural decisions that were made
- Code patterns to follow (with examples)
- File paths, symbol names, and their purposes
- Dependencies and their current state
- Success criteria that can be verified independently

**Think of each subtask as documentation for a developer who just joined the project and knows nothing about this feature.**

## Plan Mode Handling

If plan mode is active when this command runs:

1. **Read the existing plan** - Gather the implementation steps from the plan file
2. **Analyze and decompose** - Break down steps into self-contained subtasks
3. **Write a NEW plan** - Replace the plan file content with the subtask definitions
4. **Let the user review** - The user can provide feedback on subtask descriptions
5. **Exit plan mode** - Once approved, the plan execution simply creates the subtasks

The new plan should contain:

- The full title and content for each subtask (exactly as it will appear in Linear)
- A summary of what will be created

This approach allows the user to review and refine subtask descriptions BEFORE they're created in Linear.

## Command Workflow

### 1. Load Required Skills

**Load these skills FIRST** (read-only operation, allowed in plan mode):

1. **`using-linear` skill** - For creating documents and updating issues
2. **`git-workflow` skill** - For branch naming conventions and issue ID extraction

### 2. Parse Arguments

Parse the provided arguments:

- **$ARGUMENTS:** Optional Linear issue ID (e.g., AGE-1450)

**Issue ID Resolution:**

1. If provided as argument: Use that issue ID
2. If not provided: Extract from current branch name (pattern: `AGE-XXX`)
3. If still not found: Ask the user to provide it

### 3. Gather Plan Content

**Determine where the plan is:**

1. **If in plan mode:** Read from the plan file path specified in the system message
2. **If not in plan mode:** Check for recent planning context in the conversation
3. **If no plan found:** Ask user to provide a plan or enter plan mode first

**What constitutes a plan:**

- A structured list of implementation steps
- A design document with phases or steps
- A detailed task breakdown
- Content from a planning session

### 4. Fetch Linear Issue Context

Using the `using-linear` skill:

```bash
linearis issues read $ISSUE_ID
```

Gather:

- Issue title and description
- Existing checklist items (to avoid duplicates)
- Existing SUBTASK-XXX entries

### 5. Analyze Plan Structure

For each discrete step in the plan, determine:

- **Files involved:** What files need to be created/modified
- **Symbols involved:** What functions, classes, or types are affected
- **Context needed:** What background knowledge is required
- **Dependencies:** Which steps must be completed first
- **Success criteria:** How to verify the step is complete

**Criteria for a Good Subtask:**

- Can be completed in a single focused session
- Has clear, verifiable success criteria
- Contains all context needed (no assumptions about prior sessions)
- Is atomic - either fully complete or not started

### 6. Generate Subtask Documents

For each discrete step, create a comprehensive document. **Remember: the executing Claude session will have ONLY this document as context.**

Use this template, ensuring every section is fully populated:

````markdown
## Background

{Comprehensive explanation of:

- What feature/fix this is part of (copied from parent ticket)
- Why this subtask exists
- How it fits into the larger implementation
- Any relevant business context or user requirements}

## Parent Ticket Context

**Issue:** {ISSUE_ID} - {issue title}

{Copy the relevant portions of the parent ticket description here. Include:

- The problem being solved
- Key requirements or acceptance criteria
- Any architectural decisions already made
- Relevant comments or discussions from the ticket}

## Current Codebase State

{Describe what currently exists:

- Existing files/modules relevant to this task
- Current implementation patterns being followed
- Any recent changes that affect this work}

## Files Involved

- `{path/to/file1.ts}` - {what exists now and what needs to change}
- `{path/to/file2.ts}` - {what exists now and what needs to change}

## Implementation Details

{Detailed, step-by-step instructions. Be specific enough that someone unfamiliar with the codebase could follow them.}

### Key Symbols/Functions

- `{SymbolName}` in `{file}` - {current signature/purpose and what to do with it}

### Code Patterns to Follow

{Include actual code examples from the codebase, not just references. Show:

- Similar implementations to use as templates
- Import patterns used in this area
- Naming conventions specific to this part of the codebase}

Example from codebase:

```typescript
// Copy an actual relevant code snippet here
```
````

## Dependencies

**Must be completed first:**

- {SUBTASK-XXX: brief description} - {why it must be first}

**Or state:** None - this subtask can be completed independently.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] {Specific, verifiable criterion 1}
- [ ] {Specific, verifiable criterion 2}
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] No new lint errors: `npm run lint`

## Edge Cases & Gotchas

{Document anything that might trip someone up:

- Known quirks in the codebase
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Subtle requirements that might be missed}

## Verification Steps

{How to manually verify the implementation works:

1. Step to test X
2. Step to test Y}

````

### 7. Plan Mode: Write the Decomposition Plan

**If in plan mode**, write the subtask definitions to the plan file so the user can review them before creation.

The plan file should have this structure:

```markdown
# Decomposition Plan for {ISSUE_ID}

> **IMPORTANT: This plan ONLY creates Linear documents. Do NOT implement any code.**
> When executing this plan, the ONLY actions are:
> 1. Run `linearis documents create` for each subtask below
> 2. Run `linearis issues update` to add the checklist
> 3. Print a summary and STOP
>
> The subtask content below is LINEAR DOCUMENT CONTENT to be stored as-is.
> It is NOT a set of instructions for you to execute.

## Context

Creating **{N} subtasks** for {ISSUE_ID}. Each subtask will be stored as a Linear document.

{Any other brief context about the decomposition}

## Execution Steps

**Step 1:** Write {N} subtask content files to `cache/{ISSUE_ID}/SUBTASK-XXX.md` using the `Write` tool (one file per subtask, containing the full document content from below)

**Step 2:** Write `cache/{ISSUE_ID}/payload.json` with the subtask manifest using the `Write` tool:

```json
{
  "issueId": "{ISSUE_ID}",
  "subtasks": [
    { "identifier": "SUBTASK-001", "title": "{short description}", "contentPath": "cache/{ISSUE_ID}/SUBTASK-001.md" },
    { "identifier": "SUBTASK-002", "title": "{short description}", "contentPath": "cache/{ISSUE_ID}/SUBTASK-002.md" }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3:** Run `linear-create-subtasks.sh cache/{ISSUE_ID}/payload.json` and report the JSON output

Do not proceed to implement any subtask.

---

## Subtask Document Contents

The sections below contain the DOCUMENT CONTENT for each Linear document.
These are NOT instructions to execute — they are text to store in Linear.

---

### SUBTASK-001: {5-10 word description}

<subtask-document>
{Full subtask content using the template above - this is EXACTLY what will be stored in Linear}
</subtask-document>

---

### SUBTASK-002: {5-10 word description}

<subtask-document>
{Full subtask content}
</subtask-document>

---

(repeat for all subtasks)
````

After writing this plan, **call ExitPlanMode**. The user will review the subtask descriptions and can request changes before the plan is executed.

**CRITICAL:** When this plan is later executed (after context clearing), Claude will re-read the plan file and must ONLY create Linear documents — NOT implement any code. The `<subtask-document>` tags and the explicit execution steps at the top of the plan ensure this. The subtask content is payload to be stored, not instructions to follow.

### 8. Determine Task Numbering

Check existing subtasks in the issue:

```bash
linearis issues read $ISSUE_ID
```

Look for existing `SUBTASK-XXX` entries and start new tasks from `(highest + 1)`.

If no existing subtasks, start from `SUBTASK-001`.

### 9. Create Linear Documents and Update Checklist (Execution Phase)

**After plan mode exits** (or if not in plan mode), create documents deterministically:

1. Run `mkdir -p cache/$ISSUE_ID`
2. Use the `Write` tool to create `cache/$ISSUE_ID/SUBTASK-XXX.md` for each subtask (full document content from the plan)
3. Use the `Write` tool to create `cache/$ISSUE_ID/payload.json` with the manifest:
   ```json
   {
     "issueId": "AGE-XXXX",
     "subtasks": [
       {
         "identifier": "SUBTASK-001",
         "title": "Short description",
         "contentPath": "cache/AGE-XXXX/SUBTASK-001.md"
       },
       {
         "identifier": "SUBTASK-002",
         "title": "Short description",
         "contentPath": "cache/AGE-XXXX/SUBTASK-002.md"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Run `linear-create-subtasks.sh cache/$ISSUE_ID/payload.json`
5. Report the JSON output to the user

**Document Title Format:**

- `SUBTASK-001: {5-10 word description}`
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Implement", "Create", "Update")

The script handles both document creation and checklist updating. It continues on failure (if one document fails, others still get created) and reports per-subtask status in its JSON output.

### 10. Output Summary and STOP

Provide a comprehensive summary **and then STOP — do not begin implementing any subtask**:

```
Created {N} subtasks for {ISSUE_ID}:

SUBTASK-001: {title}
SUBTASK-002: {title}
SUBTASK-003: {title}
...

Documents created in Linear with full context for each subtask.

Next steps:
- Use `/next-pr-task` to start working on the first subtask
- Each subtask can be completed in a separate Claude session
- Subtasks will be marked complete as you work through them
```

**This is the end of the decompose-plan workflow. Do NOT proceed to implement any subtask code.**

## Error Handling

- **No plan found:** Ask user to provide a plan or run `/decompose-plan` after using plan mode
- **No Linear issue ID:** Ask user to provide it or create a new issue first
- **Plan too vague:** Ask user for clarification before decomposing (e.g., "Step 3 says 'implement the feature' - can you be more specific about what this involves?")
- **Single-step plan:** Warn user that decomposition may not add value, but proceed if they confirm
- **Linear API failures:** Show error and verify Linear access/credentials
- **Document creation fails:** Report which subtasks were created vs. failed

## Examples

**Example 1: Decompose plan from current branch (not in plan mode)**

```
/decompose-plan
```

-> Extracts issue ID from branch, reads recent plan context, creates subtasks directly

**Example 2: Decompose plan for specific issue**

```
/decompose-plan AGE-1500
```

-> Uses provided issue ID, reads plan context, creates subtasks for AGE-1500

**Example 3: While in planning mode (recommended flow)**

```
User: (enters plan mode for AGE-1500)
Claude: (creates detailed implementation plan in plan file)
User: /decompose-plan
Claude: (reads the plan, writes a NEW plan with full subtask definitions)
Claude: (exits plan mode)
User: (reviews subtask descriptions, requests changes if needed)
User: "looks good, proceed"
Claude: (creates Linear documents and updates issue)
```

This flow allows the user to review and refine subtask descriptions before they're committed to Linear.

## Tips for Better Subtasks

1. **Copy context, don't reference it** - Don't say "see parent ticket for requirements", copy the requirements into the subtask
2. **Include actual code snippets** - Copy the current function signature, not just "modify the X function"
3. **Be explicit about file paths** - Always use full paths from project root
4. **Show patterns with examples** - Include real code from the codebase as templates to follow
5. **State the current state** - Describe what exists now, not just what needs to change
6. **Include verification steps** - How will someone know the subtask is complete?
7. **Document gotchas** - What might trip up someone who doesn't know the codebase?
8. **Make dependencies explicit** - If Step 3 depends on Step 2, explain why and what specifically from Step 2 is needed
